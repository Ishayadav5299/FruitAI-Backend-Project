1. Overview
This is the backend for the FruitAI web application, designed to provide a RESTful API for managing fruit-related FAQs. The backend is built using Flask (or Django/FastAPI depending on your choice) and exposes multiple endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting FAQs. The application also includes proper error handling and input validation to ensure robust functionality.

2. Features
CRUD operations for managing FAQs:
Fetch all FAQs
Fetch a single FAQ by ID
Create a new FAQ
Update an existing FAQ by ID
Delete an FAQ by ID
Error handling for all endpoints with meaningful responses.
Validation of input data to ensure correctness.

3. Technologies Used
Framework: Flask (or FastAPI/Django)
Language: Python
Database: MongoDB (or SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL depending on your preference)
Dependencies: Flask-RESTful (or FastAPI/Django Rest Framework), PyMongo (for MongoDB), Pydantic (for FastAPI validation)
